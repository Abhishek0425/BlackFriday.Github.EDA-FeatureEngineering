# BlackFriday.Github.EDA-feature engineering

Introduction
This repository contains the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering performed on the Black Friday dataset. The dataset provides insights into consumer purchase behaviour during the Black Friday sales period.

Dataset Description
The Black Friday dataset comprises various features related to transactions made by customers on Black Friday. Each transaction is described by several attributes such as customer demographics, product categories, and purchase amounts.

Files
BlackFridayDataset.zip: The original dataset in CSV format.
Black Friday EDA and Feature Engineering.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA and feature engineering process.
README.md: This file provides an overview of the project.

EDA
The exploratory data analysis aims to understand the characteristics of the dataset, identify patterns, and gain insights into customer behaviour during Black Friday sales. Key steps in EDA include:
Data cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, etc.
Descriptive statistics: Summary statistics, distribution of variables, etc.
Visualization: Plots and charts to visualize relationships between variables.

Feature Engineering
Feature engineering involves creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance or gain better insights. This project features engineering techniques such as:
Encoding categorical variables.
Creating derived features.
Scaling numerical features.
have been applied to enhance the dataset for further analysis or modelling.

Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn

Feel free to explore the Jupyter Notebook or Python script provided in this repository for detailed analysis and visualization.
